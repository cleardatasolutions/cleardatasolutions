Add ability to go to specific point in TMotor (and PelcoD?).
Add enum for speeds (or equivalent) in PelcoD.
Add TMotor functions for movement (move left, right, up, down).
Allow for combined movement Pan+Tilt.
Update SetSerialData to check for FF as first byte and checksum for last. (Don't allow address of $FF).
Add TMotor events for received tilt pos and received pan pos.
Stop polling for position data when values stop changing.

Receiving both Pan and Tilt data at the same time causes on packet to overwrite the other packet.  Only receive tilt data when adjusting tilt, and pan data when adjusting pan.  Store last known tilt/pan in variables for reporting.

Address all "FIX" tags in code.

Motor does not respond with position data when directed to pan to a fixed position.  This is likely not fixable, work around it.
